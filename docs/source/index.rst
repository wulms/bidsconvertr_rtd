Welcome to BIDSconvertR's documentation!
===================================

**BIDSconvertR** is an R package for DICOM to BIDS conversion.

It uses dcm2niix by Chris Rorden and covers the whole workflow from DICOM over NIfTI to BIDS.

IT has a minimal use of terminal interaction and supports GUI's for sequence mapping and visual QC of the data.



It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
